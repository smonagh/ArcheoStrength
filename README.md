# ArcheoStrength

## About
A small flask application I put together to help keep track of my progress on the starting strength routine.
I've started this over now a few different times, so I'm hoping that by keeping track of my data I will
remain motivated to continue... we'll see!


## Installation
For first time setup, run the install.sh script. This is only tested for Ubuntu 20.xx. However, it
should be generally compliant for any system that utilizes the apt package manager

## Usage
Run the application file ArcheoEngine contained in the outermost directory. Then you can access the application in your browser by accessing http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Of course, if you are already familiar with flask then you can edit the runtime application according to your preferences.
